# Customer-Segmentation

This project was created to create a cluster on a credit card dataset which is used to carry out Customer Segmentation from a bank's credit card data. The dataset is obtained from Bigquery with queries in the notebook. The machine learning used is unsupervised machine learning with the KMeans algorithm.

## Project Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to segment customers based on their credit card usage patterns. By identifying distinct customer segments, banks can tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer service, and design targeted financial products to meet the specific needs of different customer groups.

## Problem Statement
Banks often have vast amounts of customer data, but without effective segmentation, it can be challenging to derive actionable insights. This project addresses the need to group customers into meaningful segments based on their credit card usage, allowing the bank to better understand customer behaviors and preferences.

## Background
Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of customer relationship management (CRM) for financial institutions. It helps in identifying homogeneous groups of customers who exhibit similar behavior, thereby enabling banks to provide personalized services, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize marketing efforts. Using machine learning techniques like clustering, we can uncover patterns and insights from the data that are not immediately apparent.

## Project Output

The output of this project includes:
Clusters of customers based on their credit card usage patterns.
Insights into the characteristics of each customer segment.
Visualizations to illustrate the distribution and features of the clusters.

## Methods
The project utilizes the following methods:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset and identifying patterns and trends.

Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting features that improve the clustering performance.

Modeling: Building and training the KMeans clustering model.

Evaluation: Assessing the performance and interpretability of the clusters.

# Technology Stack
